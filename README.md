# FoodaBest

A Flutter application for food safety analysis and allergen detection.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application that helps users analyze food products for allergens and safety based on their personal profiles.

### Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up your OpenAI API key:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the application with the environment variable:
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
   ```
